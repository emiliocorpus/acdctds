== ACDC STATS


{ACDC Stats}[https://acdcstats.herokuapp.com/] is a single page application constructed with Ruby on Rails and React.js that scrapes {NFL.com}[http://www.nfl.com/] to gather data on the statistics of Amari Cooper and Derek Carr. It also utilizes {ReactFlipMove}[https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move] to animate the transition between the two players. It is a simple project created to further understand Rails and React.js and serves to document the success of the young offensive core of the Oakland Raiders throughout the seasons.
